# COVID-19 Tracker

## Application Overview
This is pretty much a realtime chat application that allows multiple users to have a meaningful conversation in a dedicated virtual space. Some of the key features of the app are:

 - Allows users to create/join a chat room.
 - Displays the usernames (people) that are currently in the chat room.
 - Prevents more than a user with the same username in the same chat room.
 - Notifies the users in the chat room if a new user enters the chat, or an existing user leaves the chat room.
 - Allows user to use keyboard shortcuts to send emojis in the chat box.
